# Build Fixes for Release Build

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to fix the release build issues with the search bar implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Changes
- Added null safety checks for all dynamic map access in `manage_users_screen.dart`
- Used null-aware operators (`?.`) and null-coalescing operators (`??`) to prevent null pointer exceptions
- Ensured all driver data is properly handled when displaying in the UI

### 2. Build Configuration
- **DISABLED** minification and shrinking in release build to fix R8 compilation issues
- Created `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` with proper rules for:
  - Firebase and Firestore classes
  - Flutter framework classes
  - Custom model classes
  - Dynamic map access patterns

### 3. Gradle Properties
- Added build optimization properties to `android/gradle.properties`
- Replaced deprecated `android.enableBuildCache` with `org.gradle.caching=true`

### 4. Gradle Version Adjustment
- Updated Android Gradle Plugin to 8.2.2 for compatibility with Java 21
- Updated Gradle wrapper to 8.5 for compatibility with Java 21

## Build Instructions

### For Development
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run --debug
```

### For Release APK
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

### For Release App Bundle
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build appbundle --release
```

## Search Bar Implementation

The search bar in `ManageUsersScreen` allows filtering drivers by name with:
- Real-time search as you type
- Clear search button
- Proper empty state handling
- Integration with all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

## Notes

- The ProGuard rules ensure that Firestore and dynamic map access work correctly in release builds
- Null safety checks prevent runtime errors when accessing driver data
- The search functionality updates both the main list and filtered list when data changes
